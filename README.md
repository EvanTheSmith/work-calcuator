# Work Calculator

This simple app was created to automate common calculations on a virtual machine computer. This computer lacked most Windows apps including the Calculator and was not connected to the Internet. Initially only times and division options were implemented, but addition and subtraction have been added since. Recent features include automated clipboard copying, inputs that clear themselves after 3 seconds, and a submit button that auto fires after you paste into the second field.

Though not very practical outside of the very situation I built this for, I still wanted to add this to my Github to illustrate how even outside a genuine software engineering job, I am keeping my skills sharp, learning new ones, and always have programming on my mind. Thanks for reading this.
