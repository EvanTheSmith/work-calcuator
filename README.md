# Work Calculator

This simple app was created to simplify common calculations on a virtual machine computer. The computer lacked most Windows apps including the Calculator and was not connected to the Internet. Initially only times and division options were implemented, but addition and subtraction have been added since. Recent features include an automated clipboard copy, inputs that clear themselves after 3 seconds, and a submit button that auto fires after you paste into the second field.

While not practical outside of the very unique computer I built this for, I added this to my Github to illustrate how even outside a genuine software engineering job, I am keeping my skills sharp, learning new ones, and always have programming on my mind. Thanks for reading this.
